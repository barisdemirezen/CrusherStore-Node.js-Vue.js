# CrusherStore Node.js Vue.js
## Welcome to **Crusher Store** ##

* **I Know there are some bugs with routing on live example. Since I have finished my objectives, I'm not really willing to spend time on there bugs**

### Please install all node-modules for both projects before starting on local using; ###
```
npm install
```


### Technologies Used ###
#### Front-end #####
Vue.js with vanilla javascript and also UI Kit named StoreFront Vue.
* [Store Front UI Kit Github](https://github.com/vuestorefront)

[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org) for front-end routing.
### Back-end ###
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express.Js Framework](https://expressjs.com)
### Database ###
[Mongo.Db on cloud (Mongo Atlas)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Run App on local - Tutorial ##
* **Back-end**

To start back-end server you can use nodemon. Like code below.

* Make sure you have filled to .env file variables (I leaved them empty for you)
* Front-end rest-api endpoints are defined with localhost:3000, so if you make any port change on express.js, you also need to change them on front-end api endpoints.

```
cd api
nodemon start
```

* **Front-end**

To start front-end server you can use code below.

```
cd crushstore
npm run serve
```

* **Database Structure**

Creating at least one User document is mandatory to use cart function. After creating User document, change vuex default state like below and search for variable named *userid*
* Go to file

````
cd crushstore/src/store/index.js
````

* Before

````
userid: "6049ff7d04ec3c1e44c0b742"
````

* After

````
userid: *Your User's ObjectId as String type*
````

* Database Structure

````
